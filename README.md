# Random-String-Generator-using-Genetic-Programming-Paradigm
A genetic program to evolve a string that matches a given pattern, such as a valid email address or a password.

This code will generate a random population of strings and then evolve it over time using genetic programming. The goal is to evolve a string that matches the target string. The code will run for 100 generations and then print the best string in the population.
